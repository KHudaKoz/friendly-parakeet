## Description of Repository
​
 The Friendly Parakeet repository resulted out of a need to creat a random password generation application which generates a passwords uses criteria that the employee selects to create a strong password.  It will need to be clean and polish and working on mulitple screen sizes.    The acceptance criteria was based on the following:  

 * After clicking a "Botton", user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
 * Be able to select which criteria to include.
 * Prompted for a length of password at leate 8 charators and no more than 128 charaters.
 * When Prompted with charator types it should include idividual options for uppercase letter, lower case letter, symbols, and numbers.  
 * Imput types should be validated and must contain one charactor type.
 * Password must match all selected criteria and display in window of html page.

## How criteria was meet. 

To meet the demands of the clients, a javascript folder and page was created.  From there, the Generate Password button was link, then a function was created with multiple var goverened by while loops to create a boolean true or false statement.  From there, var were created with allowed with the use of stings which allowed for loop to generate random password based on criteria, all aided by a math.floor and math random loop.  

## What I learned

I learned simple is better.  Original code generator was based on rando generator. I did get it to function, but did not fully understand it.  As a result, with a little bit of coaching by the Tearher Assist, I was able to eleminate multiple lines of code.
