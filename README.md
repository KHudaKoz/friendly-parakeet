# Friendly Parakeet

## Description of Repository
​
 The Friendly Parakeet repository resulted out of a need to creat a random password generation application which generates a passwords uses criteria that the employee selects to create a strong password.  It will need to be clean and polish and working on mulitple screen sizes.    The acceptance criteria was based on the following:  

 * After clicking a "Botton", user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
 * Be able to select which criteria to include.
 * Prompted for a length of password at leate 8 charators and no more than 128 charaters.
 * When Prompted with charator types it should include idividual options for uppercase letter, lower case letter, symbols, and numbers.  
 * Imput types should be validated and must contain one charactor type.
 * Password must match all selected criteria and display in window of html page.  

## The Material Provided.
 The codebase presented was heavily riddle with class for form and reliant on a css.style sheet for styling and positioning.

## How It Was Fixed

In order to meet the demands of the clients, the exist code base was analyzed for HTML semantic elements.  After discovering the basic structure was designed with div element and class attributes, semantic html structure was deployed.  For example, certain div elements were convert in it semantic elements in the following order BODY, HEAD, HEADER, SECTIONS 1/HERO, SECTION 2/MAIN SERVICE, SECTION 3/BENEFITS, and FOOTER.  
Each individual change is annotated within the HTML CODE.    

## What I learned

There are always opportunities to refract and consolidate code, and do be affair to rename attribute and classes.
